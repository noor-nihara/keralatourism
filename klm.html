In the 9th Century, on his way to Canton, China, Persian merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir found Kollam to be the only port in India visited by huge Chinese junks. Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller, who was in Chinese service under Kublai Khan in 1275, visited Kollam and other towns on the west coast, in his capacity as a Chinese mandarin.Kollam is also home to one of the seven churches that were established by St Thomas.</p>

                  <p class="card-text text-left">Punalur, lying along the border of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the district of Kollam, derives its name from two words one Tamil and one Malayalam. Tamil word 'punal' means water and Malayalam word 'ooru' means place together making Punalur the place of water. Indeed Kallada flows right through the heart of the city with the famous suspension bridge hanging over it, stretching for 400 metres across its width. Panalur is known as "Pepper Village of Kerala" and is also houses a major Paper Mill established in 1850's.</p>

                    <p class="card-text text-left">Palaruvi Falls, cascading downstream from the height of 300 ft, is one of the prime attractions in Kutrallam or as some call it Courtallam, Tamil Nadu. Owing to its height; it is the 32nd highest fall in our country. The name Palaruvi means 'Stream of Milk' in the regional language.

                        Ironically it seems to be a glittering stream of milk as it flows down. Hence, the beauty of this fall stands unimaginable till witnessed with own eyes. The roaring sounds of the fall stand in stark contrast to the silence of the forests and mist-kissed mountains around it.</p>

                    <p class="card-text text-left">Nestled amidst the pretty pristine woods of Shenduruney forests, Rosemala is a well kept secret of Kerala. Located in the Aryanvaku in the Kollam district, the valley appears the unfurling petals of a rose, hence the name. The highlight of the place is that it can only be reached by a 10 km long trek through the jungle.

                        Boasting of panoramic vistas of the gorgeous surroundings, the major attractions of the place are the beautiful woods, a watch tower and the lake. The tourists are welcomed to watch sweeping views of the surroundings and of the lake from the watchtower and also of the mighty Thenmala Dam. The beautiful valley abounds in the bounty of nature and is a mesmerizing place to visit.</p>
