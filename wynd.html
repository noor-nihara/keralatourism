                  <p class="card-text text-left">Pookode Lake is a natural freshwater lake located around 2 km away from Vythiri, snuggled in the evergreen forests and wooded slopes. One of the most pretty lakes in the Wayanad, Pookode Lake is also known as Pookot Lake. The lake, accessible via motorable road is an excellent place for an outing, especially with family and loved ones. Apart from the natural view, people enjoy boating, seeing the freshwater aquarium, shopping for handicrafts and just walking around.

                    Panamaram river, which is one of the main branches of the Kabini River originates from the Pookot Lake and then joins the Panamaram valley. The Pookode Lake falls on the way back from Lakkidi towards Vythiri. It is situated at a distance of 3 km from the valley view area and 2 km away from Vythiri. The lake can be reached easily by hiring a car, bus, auto-rickshaw or taxi.</p>

                  <p class="card-text text-left">Famous for its exquisite rock and wall carvings, the pre-historic Edakkal Caves are two naturally occurring alcoves located in the Wayanad district of Kerala. The caves measure at a massive length and width of 96 and 22 feet respectively and lie 1200 metres above the sea level. Owing to its precarious location, one needs to trek for one and half hour (around 4000 ft) to hit the cave entrance, and another 45 minutes to reach the mouth of the cave. The Edakkal caves are of historical and archaeological significance as it has carvings that date back to the Neolithic era, the late Stone Age. The stonework in the interior of the cave is estimated to be as old as 5000 BC to 1000 BC.

                    Edikkal literally means 'a stone in between' and aptly describes its formation. A smaller rock has wedged in between 2 bigger ones to form a natural cave. In the truest sense of the word, it is not a cave but a natural fissure in the rock which has a heavy boulder on top. The cave thus has 2 levels.</p>

                    <p class="card-text text-left">Lying in the lap of the Banasura hills in the Wayanad district is the picturesque Banasura Sagar dam. Banasura Dam is the largest earthen dam in the country and the second-largest in Asia. The view of the sprawling reservoir from the top of the dam is breathtaking. Adventures like speed boating are readily available, and a trek up to the Banasura Peak is filled with streams, diverse flora, fauna, lush tropical green and majestic waterfalls. An earthen dam, also known as an embankment dam is created by placing mounds of clay, sand, rock or soil. The view of Banasura Lake from the top of the hill is mesmerising.
